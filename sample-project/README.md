# lein2

Project for testing lein-autoexpect with leiningen 2

## Usage

run `lein autoexpect` and `lein autoexpect :growl`. Comment and uncomment various lines in `test/sample_expectations.clj` to test out lein-autoexpect.

DON'T FORGET TO COMMENT OUT (and remove comment after) the autoexpect in your user/global lein profile or that will be used in preference to the SNAPSHOT- installed from autoexpect
